# credit-card-default-prediction

Using machine learning algorithms, a credit card default prediction analysis was conducted on a dataset of 30,000 customers from a Taiwanese bank. The class imbalance was handled using various techniques. Different machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest were applied, and Random Forest achieved the best performance with the highest recall and true positive rate, and lowest false positives. Random Forest achieved the best performance with the highest recall and true positive rate.
